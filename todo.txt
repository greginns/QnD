Migration
  One migration file for all pgschemas
  Use _master as main pgschema
  Make SQL with ${pgschema} so can be used for all
  Eventually create a startup sql file
  New pgschems would run all migration files from startup to last.
  Snapshot the models after each migration - like now.  But just for _master
